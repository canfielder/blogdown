      <description>A few years ago, as I was planning a few trips, I was trying to figure out every place I had traveled, particularly in the United States. This started with putting together every state I had gone to, but eventually the question gnawed at for long enough that I put together a list of every county I’d crossed into. That was a bit harder, but I feel confident I was able to accurately recall 95% or more of the counties I’ve been in.</description>
