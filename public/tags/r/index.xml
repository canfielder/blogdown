      <description>National parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutelydemocratic, they reflect us at our best rather than our worst.
- Wallace Stegner
I love America’s National Parks. The National Park Service administers 419 official units, of which 61 are designated National Parks, of which I’ve visited seven. My goal is to visit every single National Park, so I have a ways to go. And unfortunately, since I currently live on the eastern half of the United States, there are few parks close by.</description>

      <description>For #tidytuesday we’re looking at Amusement Park injuries. I plan on making a simple visual of the number of injuries by month.

      <description>UPDATE: The post was originally written on April 29, 2019. I had a busy summer of travel in 2019 where I visited Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Maine. I had never been to Washington, Oregon, and Utah, and I was able to travel Downeast and visit new areas of Maine. The visuals in this post have been updated accordingly. 
A few years ago, as I was planning a few trips, I was trying to figure out every place I had traveled, particularly in the United States.</description>

      <description>For the final project of the Spring 2019 DSBA 5122: Visual Analytics at University of North Carolina Charlotte class we were tasked with creating an interactive Shiny app based a topic of our choosing. Earlier in the semester I was introduced to the Washington Post article Mapping how the United States generates its electricity. I was captivated by the visuals in the article of energy generation in the Untied states and the story they told.</description>
