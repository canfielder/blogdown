      <description>Update:After getting some great feedback on twitter from the #rstats community I was able to make a few tweaks to improve the racing bar chart. I’d like to thank @CedScherer who pointed me to this great Github repo and @JonTheGeek who directed me to last weeks #TidyTuesday podcast
Racing Bar Chart!!!For #tidytuesday we’re looking at America’s National Parks! I have already blogged about how much I love the Nation Park System, so this is perfect.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: The post was originally written on April 29, 2019. I had a busy summer of travel in 2019 where I visited Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Maine. I had never been to Washington, Oregon, and Utah, and I was able to travel Downeast and visit new areas of Maine. The visuals in this post have been updated accordingly. 
A few years ago, as I was planning a few trips, I was trying to figure out every place I had traveled, particularly in the United States.</description>
